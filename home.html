        <pre> Welcome to Rock, Paper, Scissors

            How to play: Try to guess the computers move and defeat them.
        
            Rock:
            Rock beats scissors and loses to paper.
            This powerful play is strong enough to break the fragile scissors, but can't 
            fight its way past the paper, which wraps itself around the rock to suffocate it.
        
            Paper:
            Scissors beat paper but loses to rock. 
            The sharp scissors carve through paper with ease, but they're too weak 
            to stand up to a rock slamming into them.
        
            Scissors:
            Paper beats rock, but loses to scissors. 
            The slick and flexible paper wraps around the rock 
            to lock it down, but it can't fight back against the sharp scissors.
