// 
// How to play: Try to guess the computers move and defeat them.

// Rock:

// fight its way past the paper, which wraps itself around the rock to suffocate it.
// 
// Paper:
// Scissors beat paper but loses to rock. 
// The sharp scissors carve through paper with ease, but they’re too weak 
// to stand up to a rock slamming into them.
// 
// Scissors:
// Paper beats rock, but loses to scissors. 
// The slick and flexible paper wraps around the rock 
// to lock it down, but it can’t fight back against the sharp scissors.
